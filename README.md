# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on COVID-19 trends and vaccination insights in India. The analysis confirms the significant impact of vaccination campaigns on reducing mortality and improving recovery rates.

---

## Dataset Overview

This project uses two primary datasets with key information about the pandemic in India:

* **COVID-19 Cases Dataset**: Contains roughly **15,000 entries**, including date, state/union territory, confirmed cases, deaths, and cured patients.
* **Vaccination Dataset**: Consists of around **7,800 entries** with data on total dose administration, demographic details (age and gender), and specific vaccine types like **Covaxin**, **Covishield**, and **Sputnik V**.

## Key Findings & Trends

### **COVID-19 Case Trends**
* The data shows **exponential growth** in confirmed cases during peak waves.
* The **Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)**, which is the percentage of deaths out of total confirmed cases, was around **1-2%**, which is in line with global averages.
* During the second wave of 2021, the CFR temporarily went above **2.5%** in some states, reflecting the severity of that period.
* After the vaccination campaign, the **death rate declined by nearly 50%**, and the CFR dropped to **below 1%**.
* The **recovery rate improved to over 95%** in most states during the post-vaccination period.

### **Vaccination Insights**
* **Total Doses Administered**: Early in the rollout, a **100% month-on-month increase** in doses administered was observed.
* **Vaccine Share**: **Covishield** was the most common vaccine, contributing **~70-75%** of all doses, while **Covaxin** accounted for **~20-25%** and **Sputnik V** was minimal at **~5%**.
* **Gender Distribution**: **~55%** of vaccinations were given to males, compared to **~44%** for females and **less than 1%** for transgender individuals.
* **Age Distribution**: The **18-44 age group** led the vaccination drive with **~60%** of the doses, followed by the **45-60 age group at ~25%** and the **60+ age group at ~15%**.

##  Public Health Implications

This analysis highlights the critical role of mass immunization in pandemic control. The vaccination rollout clearly **flattened the curve**, leading to a reduction in both case severity and mortality.The gender and age imbalances in vaccination data underscore the need for more targeted public health campaigns for specific populations.
# **COVID-19 Dashboard**

This project presents a detailed visualization of global **COVID-19 statistics**, including confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and total testing by country.

## **Dashboard Components**

### **Top 10 Confirmed Countries**
- Bar chart showing countries with the highest confirmed COVID-19 cases.

### **Global Cases Map**
- World map displaying the geographical spread and intensity of confirmed cases.

### **Top 10 Recoveries**
- Bubble chart illustrating countries with the highest recovery numbers.

### **Total Deaths vs Total Recoveries**
- Comparison chart showing the relationship between recoveries and deaths per country.

### **Top 10 Death Cases**
- Tree map of countries reporting the highest number of total deaths.

### **Confirmed vs Death Correlation**

## **Key Insights**

- **USA, India, and Brazil** have the highest total confirmed cases and testing numbers.  
- Higher testing levels generally correspond to better recovery outcomes.  
- The **USA** records the largest number of deaths globally.  
- There are clear regional disparities in testing capacity and recovery efficiency.
