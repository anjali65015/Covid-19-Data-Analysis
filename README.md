# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on COVID-19 trends and vaccination insights in India. The analysis confirms the significant impact of vaccination campaigns on reducing mortality and improving recovery rates.

## Dataset Overview

This project uses two primary datasets with key information about the pandemic in India:

* [cite_start]**COVID-19 Cases Dataset**: Contains roughly **15,000 entries**, including date, state/union territory, confirmed cases, deaths, and cured patients[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]**Vaccination Dataset**: Consists of around **7,800 entries** with data on total dose administration, demographic details (age and gender), and specific vaccine types like **Covaxin**, **Covishield**, and **Sputnik V**[cite: 4].

## Key Findings & Trends

### **COVID-19 Case Trends**
* [cite_start]The data shows **exponential growth** in confirmed cases during peak waves[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]The **Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)**, which is the percentage of deaths out of total confirmed cases, was around **1-2%**, which is in line with global averages[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]During the second wave of 2021, the CFR temporarily went above **2.5%** in some states, reflecting the severity of that period[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]After the vaccination campaign, the **death rate declined by nearly 50%**, and the CFR dropped to **below 1%**[cite: 16, 37, 47].
* [cite_start]The **recovery rate improved to over 95%** in most states during the post-vaccination period[cite: 39, 48].

### **Vaccination Insights**
* [cite_start]**Total Doses Administered**: Early in the rollout, a **100% month-on-month increase** in doses administered was observed[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Vaccine Share**: **Covishield** was the most common vaccine, contributing **~70-75%** of all doses, while **Covaxin** accounted for **~20-25%** and **Sputnik V** was minimal at **~5%**[cite: 22, 23, 24].
* [cite_start]**Gender Distribution**: **~55%** of vaccinations were given to males, compared to **~44%** for females and **less than 1%** for transgender individuals[cite: 27, 28, 29].
* [cite_start]**Age Distribution**: The **18-44 age group** led the vaccination drive with **~60%** of the doses, followed by the **45-60 age group at ~25%** and the **60+ age group at ~15%**[cite: 31, 32, 33, 49].

##  Public Health Implications

[cite_start]This analysis highlights the critical role of mass immunization in pandemic control[cite: 50]. [cite_start]The vaccination rollout clearly **flattened the curve**, leading to a reduction in both case severity and mortality[cite: 42]. [cite_start]The gender and age imbalances in vaccination data underscore the need for more targeted public health campaigns for specific populations[cite: 43].
